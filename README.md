# New and Updated LAB deployment  
With new hardware and MDT in route to the grave, I wanted to redo the process I have of deploying my LAB, and all the diffrent workloads that I use from time to time.  
  
I have chosen to use Proxmox as Hypervisor, I know that this might be a strange desission from a MS consultant, but I like the interface and lightweight footprint, and ease of use API.  
  
Scripts in the Proxmox folder contains the functions to create Default Server Template, and later multiple VMs depending on workload.  
  
Script in the Windows Servers contains individual server scripts.  
  
  
## To get started.
